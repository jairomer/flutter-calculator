# scientific_calculator

A simple scientific calculator made with Flutter.

## What is this?
This is a training wheels project with as little help from external libraries as possible.

It turns out that building a calculator from scratch is not as easy as it seems.

I will also use this project as a way to improve my algorithmic skills by relying as little as 
possible from Math libraries.

## Why did you do this?

To learn how to work with Flutter in my quest for becoming a full stack engineer. 

## What did you learn?

As of yet, I am still learning lots of things, but the objective is to acquire:
- Experience building multiplatform applications with Flutter.
- Experience with datastructures and algorithms.
- Experience publishing the final product in Github.
- Experience publishing the final product to application stores.
